# Simple Node.js HTTP webserver

This is a very simple HTTP webserver, written with Node.js and Express framework.
The aim of this project is to have a lightweight and quick to run HTTP webserver, that can be used to serve static html web pages.

### Requirements

Just [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

### How to install it

Just run `npm install` on the command line to install the dependencies.

### How to run it

Just execute the following command:

```
node server.js
```

Once the server is running, just open the web browser and go to the address `http://localhost:7999`, put your static files on the `/public` and you are ready to go :-)
